# batch-operations-on-QBlade-s-plr-files-to-OpenFAST
This is a simple small program written in matlab, which can batch process the 360-degree POLAR coordinate airfoil data output by QBlade and finally generate a polar file that can be called in OpenFAST's AD这是一个由matlab编写的简单的小程序，可将QBlade输出的360极坐标翼型数据批量处理，最后生成一个能够在OpenFAST的AD中调用的POLAR文件。
